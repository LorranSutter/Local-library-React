# Local Library - React

This project is an extension of a previous version of a tutorial from [Developer Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Tutorial_local_library_website) to build a Local Library using [Express JS](http://expressjs.com/).

This application was developed using React as frontend, but also you can check this application implemented using Pug template [here](https://github.com/LorranSutter/Local-library).

<!-- ## :runner: How to run

Open your terminal in the folder you want to clone the project

```sh
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/LorranSutter/Local-library.git

# Go to the project folder
cd Local-library

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the project
npm start
```

If you want to use your own mongodb account, replace the following variable with your own mongo URL:

```sh
# Go to connectionDB.js
MONGOURI = <your-url>
```

Then you may populate your database using the following command:

```sh
node populatedb.js
``` -->
