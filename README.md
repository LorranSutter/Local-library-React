# Local Library - React

This project is an extension of a previous version of a tutorial from [Developer Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Tutorial_local_library_website) to build a Local Library using [Express JS](http://expressjs.com/).

This application was developed using React as frontend, but also you can check this application implemented using Pug template [here](https://github.com/LorranSutter/Local-library).

## :straight_ruler: Development pipeline and challenges

***Development still in progress***. Follow some steps already done:

1. As mentioned above, this project is an extension of a previous version. I have decided to extend this version so as to I could learn more about [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/). For such, I should start turning my Pug template into a API.

2. Initially, I started this project to learn more about ReactJS. However, I realized that it was the opportunity to improve another skill: **testing**.

3. Before moving to frontend development with React, I set out to build test cases to my API. I chose to use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) as my testing framework, due to its simplicity and because I had already have some contact with this tool.

    In the meanwhile, I got confused with integrating properly my API with Jest using mongo as database. I found this blog [Endpoint testing](https://zellwk.com/blog/endpoint-testing/) as a valuable source to help me on this path.

4. Next step: ReactJS frontend finally. Or should I say "TDD with React"?

<!-- ## :runner: How to run

Open your terminal in the folder you want to clone the project

```sh
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/LorranSutter/Local-library.git

# Go to the project folder
cd Local-library

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the project
npm start
```

If you want to use your own mongodb account, replace the following variable with your own mongo URL:

```sh
# Go to connectionDB.js
MONGOURI = <your-url>
```

Then you may populate your database using the following command:

```sh
node populatedb.js
``` -->
